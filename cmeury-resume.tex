\noindent \emph{Resourceful, enthusiastic and sociable geek with a long-time passion for computer science and information technology, a background in molecular biology and a knack for quality software.}
\\
\\
At the age of 13 (1996) I wrote my first applications in QBasic. I then taught myself Pascal, Perl, \acr{C} and \acr{C++} from text-books which sparked my passion for software engineering. Setting up a home network and Linux-based server served as a play-ground for working with operating systems, protocols and services.

To understand how nature tackles the problem of encoding complex living things in DNA, I studied and graduated in Molecular Biology at the University of Basel (2008). A minor in Computer Science was a natural choice.

After my graduation, the bioinformatics company Genedata hired me as a Test Engineer. My careful and thorough testing efforts in close collaboration with developers resulted in high quality releases.

To explore the quickly growing field of IT in pharmaceutical research I took on a position at the bio-tech company Actelion. I have enabled scientists to work efficiently by maintaining a diverse set of laboratory software. 

During this time, I was politicized by global events and started voluntary work for the Pirate Party in my spare-time. As elected president of the Pirates in Basel I strive to establish information policy as a topic in the local debate.

In 2011, I joined Netbreeze as a Software Engineer in the core development team. I contribute to the main product on both front-end and back-end sides. The web application is closely tied to the fast moving and ever-growing world of social media. For a new feature, I have developed a prototype that stores data from a large data stream in the Solr indexing server.
