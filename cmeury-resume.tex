\noindent \emph{Resourceful, enthusiastic and sociable geek with a long-time passion for computer science and information technology, a background in molecular biology and a knack for quality software.}
\\
\\
Learning from books I wrote my first QBasic application at the age of 13. Later I delved into Pascal, Perl, \acr{C} and \acr{C++}. My passion for software engineering was sparked.

To understand how nature tackles the engineering problem of encoding complex living things in DNA, I graduated in Molecular Biology in 2008. A minor in Computer Science was a natural choice.

After my graduation, the bioinformatics company Genedata hired me as a Test Engineer. My careful and thorough testing efforts in close collaboration with developers resulted in high quality releases.

To explore the quickly growing field of IT in pharmaceutical research I took on a position at the bio-tech company Actelion. I have enabled scientists to work efficiently by maintaining a diverse set of laboratory software. 

During this time, I was politicized by global events and started voluntary work for the Pirate Party in my spare-time. As elected president of the Pirates in Basel I strive to establish information policy as a topic in the local debate.

In 2011, I joined Netbreeze as a Software Engineer in the core development team. I contribute to the main product on the front- and back-end. The web application is closely tied to the fast moving and ever-growing world of social media. For a new feature, I have developed a prototype that stores data from a large data stream in the Solr indexing server.

The roller-coaster ride of being acquired by Microsoft in Spring 2013 is unforgettable. The challenges of producing high-quality, scalable and compliant platform push me into new areas and teach me a lot.
