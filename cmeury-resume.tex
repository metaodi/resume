At the age of eight (1991) I wrote my first lines of code in QBasic. Following Pascal and Perl, I meticulously worked through a \acr{C}/\acr{C++} text-book which  sparked my passion for software engineering.  Building up a home network including a Linux-based server I enjoyed the challenges of the interplay between operating systems, protocols and services.

To find out how living cells are programmed and engineered, I graduated in Molecular Biology at the University of Basel (2008). A minor in Computer Science was a natural choice.

After my graduation, the bioinformatics company Genedata accepted me as a trainee and shortly after hired me as a Test Engineer. Venturing into the world of professional testing, my careful and thorough testing efforts resulted in increasingly robust development and high quality releases.

To explore the quickly growing field of IT in biological and pharmaceutical research I took on a position at the bio-tech company Actelion. I have enabled scientists to work efficiently by maintaining a diverse set of research software. When a managed client was rolled out company-wide, I took responsibility for legacy software and succeeded in ensuring a high acceptance rate in that demanding environment.

During this time, I was politicized by global events and started voluntary work for the Pirate Party in my spare-time. As elected president of the Pirates in Basel I strive to establish information policy as a topic in the local debate.

In 2011, I joined Netbreeze as a Software Engineer in the core development team. I contribute to the main product on both front-end and back-end sides. The web application is closely tied to the fast moving and ever-growing world of social media. For a new feature, I have developed a prototype that stores data from a large data stream in the Solr indexing server.
