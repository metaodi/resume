\noindent \emph{Resourceful, enthusiastic and sociable geek with a long-time passion for software engineering, a background in molecular biology and a knack for quality software.}
\\
\\
Learning QBasic, Pascal, Perl and C++ in my teens sparked my passion for software engineering. To understand how nature solved engineering problems, I graduated as a Molecular Biologist in 2008, with a minor in Computer Science.

I delved into the challenging world of Software Test Engineering at the bioinformatics company Genedata. A couple of high quality releases later I joined pharmaceutical research IT at the bio-tech company Actelion, enabling scientists to work efficiently by maintaining a diverse set of laboratory software. 

Politicized by global events I started working as elected President for the Pirate Party Basel in my spare-time and later full-time. Having gathered an enthusiastic base I strived to establish information policy as a topic in the local debate.

In 2011 I joined Netbreeze as a Software Engineer in the core development team. The social media monitoring product attracted interest from Microsoft leading to the acquisition of Netbreeze in Spring 2013. The challenges of producing a high-quality, scalable and compliant platform have led me into new and exciting areas of Software Engineering.

Other duties included operating the productive system on AWS nodes running Linux were my main duties or capturing big data streams into a Solr indexing server. My contributions to methodology were greatly valued, the team-chat facilitates communication between distributed team members and the new wiki software leads to quality documentation. After being integrated into the Microsoft family, I facilitated getting the Netbreeze software to pass legal and security quality gates. As an engineer and scrum master I took a major role in converting the existing code-base into a scalable platform, deploying it using Puppet and moving the back-end from AWS to Azure and Postgres to SQL Azure. Currently, I am part of a multi-disciplinary service engineering team and design, plan and implement a cloud provisioning framework based on Groovy and YAML for integration with Puppet and Hiera.}}
